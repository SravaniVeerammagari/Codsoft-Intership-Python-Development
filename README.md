# Python simple projects
Welcome to the repository showcasing the projects I completed during my Python development internship at CodSoft. Over the course of this internship, I honed my skills in Python and its built-in libraries by working on various practical tasks. Each project reflects my growth and understanding of python development fundamentals, as well as my commitment to producing clean, efficient code.
# Projects Includes :
# 1. To-Do List
This Project To-Do List application allows users to manage tasks through a simple command-line interface. Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks, with all data saved in a JSON file for persistence. The program is designed for ease of use, making task management straightforward and efficient.
# 2. Calculator
Implemented a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can choose an operation and input two numbers, with results displayed in a user-friendly format. The calculator also includes error handling for division by zero, ensuring robust performance.
# 3. Password Generator
Generates a secure random password based on user-defined length, with a minimum requirement of 8 characters. It combines lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters to create a strong password. The user-friendly interface guides input and displays the generated password, ensuring ease of use.
# 4. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where users compete against the computer. Players input their choice, and the program randomly selects the computer's choice, determining the winner based on traditional game rules. The game tracks scores and allows users to play multiple rounds, providing an engaging and interactive experience.
# 5. Contact Book
A Contact Management System, allowing users to manage their contacts through a command-line interface. Users can add, update, delete, search, and display contacts, with all data stored in a JSON file for persistence. The application is user-friendly and designed to simplify contact organization and retrieval.

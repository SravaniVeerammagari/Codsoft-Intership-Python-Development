# Python simple projects
Welcome to the repository showcasing the projects I completed during my Python development internship at CodSoft. Over the course of this internship, I honed my skills in Python and its built-in libraries by working on various practical tasks. Each project reflects my growth and understanding of python development fundamentals, as well as my commitment to producing clean, efficient code.

# Projects Includes :

# Calculator
Implemented a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can choose an operation and input two numbers, with results displayed in a user-friendly format. The calculator also includes error handling for division by zero, ensuring robust performance.
# Contact Book
A Contact Management System, allowing users to manage their contacts through a command-line interface. Users can add, update, delete, search, and display contacts, with all data stored in a JSON file for persistence. The application is user-friendly and designed to simplify contact organization and retrieval.
# Palindrome Checker
A simple Python function to check if a given string is a palindrome. It removes any non-alphanumeric characters, converts the string to lowercase, and then checks if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
# Password Generator
Generates a secure random password based on user-defined length, with a minimum requirement of 8 characters. It combines lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters to create a strong password. The user-friendly interface guides input and displays the generated password, ensuring ease of use.
# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where users compete against the computer. Players input their choice, and the program randomly selects the computer's choice, determining the winner based on traditional game rules. The game tracks scores and allows users to play multiple rounds, providing an engaging and interactive experience.
# String reversal
Used two simple Python functions to reverse a given string using different methods: slicing and a for loop.
Features
1. String Reversal using Slicing: Utilizes Python's slicing feature for a concise and efficient way to reverse strings.
2. String Reversal using For Loop: Demonstrates a more manual approach by iterating through the string and building the reversed version.
# Temperature Conversion
It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Users input the temperature value and specify the unit of measurement (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit). The script then performs the conversion and displays the result.
# To-Do List
This Project To-Do List application allows users to manage tasks through a simple command-line interface. Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks, with all data saved in a JSON file for persistence. The program is designed for ease of use, making task management straightforward and efficient.
